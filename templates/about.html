            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
                coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has
                resulted in an ongoing pandemic. The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November
                2019 in Hubei. As of 9 July 2020, more than 12.1 million cases have been reported across 188
                countries and territories, resulting in more than 552,000 deaths. More than 6.69 million people have
                recovered. </p>
            <p>Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and
                taste. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute
                respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm, multi-organ failure,
                septic shock, and blood clots. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically
                around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.</p>
            <p>Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance
                from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms),
                covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of cloth face
                coverings such as a scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public settings to
                minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use. Health officials
                also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should only be used by healthcare workers,
                first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals.</p>
